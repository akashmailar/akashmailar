- üìä Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL
- üìà Data Visualization: Tableau, Power BI
- üõ†Ô∏è Other Tools: Excel, Jupyter Notebooks, Git

### Featured Projects:
- [**Tata Steel Machine Failure Prediction - EDA**](https://github.com/akashmailar/Tata-Steel-Machine-Failure-Prediction):- This project focuses on predicting machine failures in ***Tata Steel***'s manufacturing operations using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The dataset contains **136,429 rows** and **14 columns**, providing valuable insights into the operational conditions of machines. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to machine failures, enabling early detection and minimizing downtime, improving safety, and reducing maintenance costs.

- [Walmart Data Analysis - Python+SQL](https://github.com/akashmailar/Walmart-Sales-Analysis-Python-SQL):- This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions. The project is ideal for data analysts looking to develop skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and data pipeline creation.

- [Library Data Analysis - SQL](https://github.com/akashmailar/Library-management-system-using-SQL):- This project demonstrates the implementation of a Library Management System using SQL. It includes creating and managing tables, performing CRUD operations, and executing advanced SQL queries. The goal is to showcase skills in database design, manipulation, and querying.
  
- [E-Commerce Sales Anlysis (EDA) - Python](https://github.com/akashmailar/E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis):- This project aims to analyze e-commerce sales data to derive insights that can help businesses understand customer behavior, sales trends, and areas for improvement. Through the analysis, we explore key metrics like sales growth, seasonal trends, customer demographics, and product performance.

### Currently Learning:
- Deepening my knowledge of Machine Learning for predictive analytics.
- Exploring advanced SQL techniques for efficient data querying.
