- üìä Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL
- üìà Data Visualization: Tableau, Power BI
- üõ†Ô∏è Other Tools: Excel, Jupyter Notebooks, Git


## Featured Projects:
- [**Tata Steel Machine Failure Prediction**](https://github.com/akashmailar/Tata-Steel-Machine-Failure-Prediction):- This project focuses on predicting machine failures in ***Tata Steel***'s manufacturing operations using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The dataset contains **136,429 rows** and **14 columns**, providing valuable insights into the operational conditions of machines. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to machine failures, enabling early detection and minimizing downtime, improving safety, and reducing maintenance costs.

- [**Yes Bank Stock Prices Analysis**](https://github.com/akashmailar/Yes-Bank-Stock-Analysis-EDA):- This project conducts an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of ***Yes Bank***'s stock prices from **July 2005 to November 2020**. The analysis aims to uncover trends, patterns, and insights into the stock price movements over the years. Given ***Yes Bank***'s financial turbulence, particularly during the **2020 crisis**, this study helps in understanding the historical fluctuations in stock prices.

- [**Library Management System Analysis**](https://github.com/akashmailar/Library-management-system-using-SQL):- This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Library Management System using SQL**. It includes **creating and managing tables, performing CRUD operations**, and **executing advanced SQL queries**. The goal is to showcase skills in database design, manipulation, and querying.

- [**Amazon Prime TV Shows And Movies Data Analysis**](https://github.com/akashmailar/amazon-prime-analysis):- This **Amazon Prime TV Shows and Movies Data Analysis** project focuses on exploring and analyzing content available on ***Amazon Prime***. The dataset consists of two CSV files: **`titles.csv`** and **`credits.csv`**, providing comprehensive information on movies, TV shows, ratings, popularity, genres, and cast/crew details. The dataset specifically contains data available in the **United States**.

- [**FlipKart Customer Service Satisfaction**](https://github.com/akashmailar/FlipKart-Customer-Service-Satisfaction-EDA):- This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a ***Flipkart*** dataset to uncover key trends in product pricing, ratings, customer reviews, and category distributions. By using Python‚Äôs robust data science libraries, we aim to gain meaningful insights that can drive better business decisions. Through **data cleaning, visualization**, and **statistical analysis**, we explore various aspects of the dataset, such as price variations across categories, rating distributions, and correlations between features. The findings from this analysis can help businesses optimize their product listings and pricing strategies on ***Flipkart***.
