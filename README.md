## Hi there! üëã
I‚Äôm Akash, a data analyst who‚Äôs passionate about using data to drive decisions and solve real-world problems.

### Skills and Tools:
- üìä Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL
- üìà Data Visualization: Tableau, Power BI
- üõ†Ô∏è Other Tools: Excel, Jupyter Notebooks, Git

### Featured Projects:
- [**Tata Steel Machine Failure Prediction - EDA**](https://github.com/akashmailar/Tata-Steel-Machine-Failure-Prediction):- This project focuses on predicting machine failures in ***Tata Steel***'s manufacturing operations using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The dataset contains **136,429 rows** and **14 columns**, providing valuable insights into the operational conditions of machines. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to machine failures, enabling early detection and minimizing downtime, improving safety, and reducing maintenance costs.

- [**Yes Bank Stock Prices Analysis - EDA**](https://github.com/akashmailar/Yes-Bank-Stock-Analysis-EDA):- This project conducts an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of ***Yes Bank***'s stock prices from **July 2005 to November 2020**. The analysis aims to uncover trends, patterns, and insights into the stock price movements over the years. Given ***Yes Bank***'s financial turbulence, particularly during the **2020 crisis**, this study helps in understanding the historical fluctuations in stock prices.

- [**Library Management System Analysis - SQL**](https://github.com/akashmailar/Library-management-system-using-SQL):- This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Library Management System using SQL**. It includes creating and managing tables, performing CRUD operations, and executing advanced SQL queries. The goal is to showcase skills in database design, manipulation, and querying.
  
- [E-Commerce Sales Anlysis (EDA) - Python](https://github.com/akashmailar/E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis):- This project aims to analyze e-commerce sales data to derive insights that can help businesses understand customer behavior, sales trends, and areas for improvement. Through the analysis, we explore key metrics like sales growth, seasonal trends, customer demographics, and product performance.

### Currently Learning:
- Deepening my knowledge of Machine Learning for predictive analytics.
- Exploring advanced SQL techniques for efficient data querying.
